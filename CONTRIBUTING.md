## GitHub Repository

The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/oz-geom-pde/csf). Consult [Get started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) for information on how to work with GitHub.

#### Forking and Cloning

The first thing to do is to [fork](https://github.com/oz-geom-pde/csf/fork) the project repository so you have your own copy of the repository. See [Fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for further information. Once you have a fork in your own GitHub account, you should [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it on your local machine to begin working on it.

#### GitHub Flow

A useful approach to working on GitHub projects is to use the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow). It's a method for tracking changes and submitting them for inclusion in the project.

#### Submitting Pull requests

When you have finished working on some aspect of the project you need to submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) for your work to be incorporated into the project.

## MyST Markdown

The project is based on [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/). [Installation instructions](https://mystmd.org/guide/installing) are here. Once that's done, open a command line and change directory into your clone. Then execute

```shell
myst start --execute
```

You should see something like the following:

Now you can access the project website via your browser via the link printed at the bottom. In this case it's `http://localhost:3000` but it may be different for you.

For details on MyST Markdown syntax and general information on working with it, see the [MyST guide](https://mystmd.org/guide).

## Executing notebooks in Jupyter

Notebooks can be executed in Jupyter which provides a convenient authoring environment for both text and for code. Consult [Executable Markdown Files](https://mystmd.org/guide/notebooks-with-markdown) for information including installing Jupyter server.
